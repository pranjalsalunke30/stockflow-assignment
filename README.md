# StockFlow – Inventory Management System

# StockFlow Case Study

This repository contains my solution for the **StockFlow B2B Inventory Management** case study.  
The assignment is divided into three parts: code review & debugging, database design, and API implementation.

---

## Description

The goal of this case study was to:

1. Review and debug starter code.
2. Design and implement a relational database schema using PostgreSQL.
3. Implement RESTful APIs using Node.js, Express, and Sequelize ORM.

The solution includes properly defined models, relationships, validations, and API endpoints.  
All endpoints were tested with Postman, and sample responses are included in the corresponding part folders.

## Parts

1. [Part 1: Code Review & Debugging](part1_code_review.md)  
   Fixes errors in starter code, resolves undefined imports, and ensures the server runs without crashes.

2. [Part 2: Database Design](part2_database_design.md)  
   Sequelize models and PostgreSQL tables for Product, Inventory, Warehouse, Supplier, and Sales.  
   Includes relationships, constraints, and sample insert queries.

3. [Part 3: API Implementation](part3_api_implementation/)  
   REST APIs for creating products, managing inventory, fetching low-stock alerts, and sales.  
   Includes sample JSON responses and error handling.
